# Installation

Project is in **PLANNING** stage where necessary research is conducted before we even will be speaking about development and timelines. End-goal for installation is a UNIX-distributed binary, Windows binary and MacOS binary - all of them should be installable into `$PATH` to be accessible from CLI - there are tons of projects that are providing web interface so it's not really a concern of my project.
