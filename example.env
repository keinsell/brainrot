# and ip address or domain name for production.
HOST="localhost"

# PORT stands for port on which application will be run
# It is recommended to use 80 or 443 for production
# and 1337 for development and testing in case where
# port will be taken application will try to use any
# other port available.
PORT=1337

# PROTOCOL stands for describing prefered protocol for connection
# Some environments will apply it's own SSL over HTTP in some other

#
# !!! IMPORTANT !!!
# In case of using URI all other variables will be ignored
# it's recommended to replace URI from default one if you
# are not using provided docker-compose.
# --------------------------------

REDIS_URI=${REDIS_PROTOCOL}://${REDIS_HOST}:${REDIS_PORT}/${REDIS_DB}

# REDIS_PROTOCOL stands for protocol used to connect to redis
# it's used only for construction of REDIS_URI
REDIS_PROTOCOL="redis"

# REDIS_HOST stands for host on which redis is running
REDIS_HOST="localhost"

# REDIS_PORT stands for port on which redis is running
REDIS_PORT=6379

# REDIS_USERNAME stands for username used to connect to redis
REDIS_USERNAME=""

# REDIS_PASSWORD stands for password used to connect to redis
REDIS_PASSWORD=""

# REDIS_DB stands for database number used to connect to redis
REDIS_DB=0

# REDIS_SSL stands for whether to use SSL for redis connection

# --------------------------------
# Database Configuration
# --------------------------------
# There are two options for database configuration
# 1. Use a URI
# 2. Use a host, port, username, password, and database name

# In case of using URI all other variables will be ignored
# it's recommended to replace URI from default one if you

DATABASE_PROTOCOL="postgres"

# DATABASE_HOST stands for host on which database is running
DATABASE_HOST="postgres.local"

# DATABASE_PORT stands for port on which database is running
DATABASE_PORT=80

# DATABASE_USERNAME stands for username used to connect to database
