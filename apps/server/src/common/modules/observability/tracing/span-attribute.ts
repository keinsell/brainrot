/**
 * OpenTelemetry spans can be created freely and itâ€™s up to the implementor to annotate them with attributes specific
 * to the represented operation. Spans represent specific operations in and between systems. Some of these operations
 * represent calls that use well-known protocols like HTTP or database calls. Depending on the protocol and the type of
 * operation, additional information is needed to represent and analyze a span correctly in monitoring systems. It is
 * also important to unify how this attribution is made in different languages. This way, the operator will not need to
 * learn specifics of a language and telemetry collected from polyglot (multi-language) micro-service environments can
 * still be easily correlated and cross-analyzed.
 * @see [OpenTelemtry's Trace Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/trace/)
