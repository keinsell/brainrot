# Organization-Wide Infrastructure

This repository is dedicated to organization-wide resources and tools, focusing on the infrastructure side of software
development. Here, you'll find configurations and implementations for various services used by different teams within an
organization. In some cases, this might include a central `infrastructure` repository using Terraform.

As a repository is built with a broke developer, without willing to spend a lot of money on the cloud infrastructure,
as 20% uptime for most of these services is just enough, in my opinion (#whoCaresAboutLogs) I'll self-host most of the
crap that I need, with a fancy way of setup.
