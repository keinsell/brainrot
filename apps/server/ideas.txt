- "OperationFramework", an set of decorators and abstracts that will help enforce and monitor operations that happen in the system along with creating a index of operations in system for future reference. Ex. "register-account", "get-account" etc. With combination of hooks pre-execution and post-execution, we can enforce and monitor things at really granular level. This will eventually help in creating a audit log of operations in the system.
