# `@mph/opentelemetry`

Github is full of forks from one or two repositories implementing OpenTelemetry in Nest.js - almost all of these
repositories are outdated or use outdated versions of OpenTelemetry. This repository is an attempt to create a
replacement which eventually also will become outdated and not maintained as well.

## TODOs

- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Sentry Integration
- [ ] Jaeger Integration
