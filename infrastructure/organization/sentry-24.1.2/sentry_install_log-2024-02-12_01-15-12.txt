Hey, so ... we would love to automatically find out about issues with your
Sentry instance so that we can improve the product. Turns out there is an app
for that, called Sentry. Would you be willing to let us automatically send data
about your instance upstream to Sentry for development and debugging purposes?

  y / yes / 1
  n / no / 0

(Btw, we send this to our own self-hosted Sentry instance, not to Sentry SaaS,
so that we can be in this together.)

Here's the info we may collect:

  - OS username
  - IP address
  - install log
  - runtime errors
  - performance data

Thirty (30) day retention. No marketing. Privacy policy at sentry.io/privacy.

y or n? 
Understood. To avoid this prompt in the future, use one of these flags:

  --report-self-hosted-issues
  --no-report-self-hosted-issues

or set the REPORT_SELF_HOSTED_ISSUES environment variable:

  REPORT_SELF_HOSTED_ISSUES=1 to send data
  REPORT_SELF_HOSTED_ISSUES=0 to not send data
