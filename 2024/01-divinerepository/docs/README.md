# Welcome to Plygrnd! üèñÔ∏è

Repository had a lot of concepts and cool name, eventually I've decided to make this repository as the one for everything and nothing, for me, it doesn't have sense to build `x` repositories for hundreds of different projects and then eventually do not finish any of these because of my damn ADHD, so I've decided to move all of them inside one place and by doing so opening one repository will always lead to little progress forward something - as every application and package is at the reach of the hand.

Repository can be treated as boilerplate for new projects however I would actually recommend to copy code that suit somebody needs and use it on their own.
