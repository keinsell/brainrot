# ðŸª· Alice, NPC for your software project!

Alice is a composable monolith of available Large Language Model (LLM) tooling to provide you hassle-free environment to burn computing resources on inefficient solutions such as gorrila-iq llms that will bash their head to the wall to acomplish virtually impossible task assigned to them, as we both know - they are stupid as fuck man.

Purpose of product is purely experimental and I would not be suprised if all of this will be archived tomorrow, in a week, month or maybe in a year, with the flow of time all the efforts that we have invested in AI seems to be pretty hopeless and costs of computing are increasing from month to month.

Anyway, Buckle in.

## TL;DR.

- `alice (init)alize`, setup a existing directory for usage of `alice`. This will start indexing files into local database, will vectorize available information and modify your `.gitignore` to do not contain cache files and others like that.
- `alice [q]uest`, command dedicated for manipulation of **Quests** which are definitions of task that are supposed to be done on codebase.
- `alice [t]ask`
- `alice [s]earch`
- `alice [u]sage`, an integrated price-tracking tooling that monitor spending on autonomous model.
