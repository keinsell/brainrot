# Quest



* Quests should be persisted in `.alice` directory inside repository or at the global storage in XDG directories.
* Quests should be stored in human-readable format (preferably in `typst` or `markdown`) which allows redefinition and edits of ones without additional tooling.
* Quest are post-processed by cheaper language models and are enriched with machine-readable context.
* Quests can have multiple [objectives.md](objectives.md "mention") defined, which are “the standard” of how the task should be accomplished.
