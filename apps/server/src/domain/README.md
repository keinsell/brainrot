# Domain

This directory contains the domain logic of the application. This is shared through different modules, acts like a
centralized management of business logic no matter of futher technological choices and implementations.

Depending on application architecture this may be sliced through smaller modules and contained into original modules,
however for building a monolith this is a good starting point since you have easy overview of all the business logic in
one place.
