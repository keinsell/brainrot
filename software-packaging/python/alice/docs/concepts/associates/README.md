# Associates

Each [quest](../quest/ "mention") definition is forwarded straight into [innkeeper.md](innkeeper.md "mention") associate which will use existing project knowledge to fill the gaps in quest definition and define clean understandable goals for other associates to which quest will be forwarded. For this process the reflective and capable models are recommended, huge context window is actually a big plus since we can provide understanding why change is being made and where it should be made.
