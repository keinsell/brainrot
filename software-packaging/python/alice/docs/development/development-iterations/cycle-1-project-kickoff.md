# Cycle/1: Project Kickoff

Being honest, it's a little bit weird jumping _that much_ into unknown as software engineer and while I see like cool picture of product that may work I do not see simplest possible implementation of such tool.

I think starting point of tool somewhat similar to [mods](https://github.com/charmbracelet/mods) would be okay for nearest time, especially with local-first approach - the core objective for starting with such project is actually to run large language model by single binary in Rust or Mojo without downloading and hosting stuff. Then we'll explore what's possible further.
