## Features

- `[TODO]` **⚡🔋 High Fckin' Voltage Batteries Included**, boilerplate it's providing all of the information needed and documentation to just plug-and-play all of the features, starting from setupping databases in local environment and ending up at "good enough" Continous Integration (CI) pipeline to start playing with your aplicaiton.
- **🍭 Eye Candies**, who would like to look at boring wall of text all the time, since start of application it gives you nice and friendly developer feel, as all of us - we're keeping candies for ourselves so these features are disabled for "serious" deployments.
