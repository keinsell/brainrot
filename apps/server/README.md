# `server`


## Features

- **üç≠ Eye Candies**, who would like to look at a boring wall of text all the time, since start of application it gives
  you
  nice and friendly developer feel, as all of us - keeping candies for ourselves so these features are disabled
  for "serious" deployments.
- **"Where is the fucking documentation?"**, no fucking more fellas, there you have static documentation dedicated for
  Angular-like projects (`compodoc`), static generation of `GraphQL` documentation, `Swagger` documentation for REST
  API, and `eventsdoc` for event-driven applications. I would like to document websockets with `asyncapi` but sorry
  ecosystem isn't ready for that yet. I mean... You still can completly do not give a fuck about documentation and will
  hear such thing but I think you can say you tried at least lol
