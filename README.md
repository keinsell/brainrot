## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Application requires few standard tools to be installed on your machine, you can find them below:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/)
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com)

#### Recommended Knowledge

Repository isn't mean to be next "copy-paste" boilerplate, it is mean to be a boilerplate that you can use to learn and
actually use a little of such code for your own purposes. Also this repository will/should appearch somehow complicated
for new programmers however I swear things aren't as much complicated as they could be once you will understand internal
library, I recommend you to have at least basic knowledge about
following topics:

- Essential knowledge about TypeScript
- Essential knowledge about Docker and Docker Compose
- Essential knowledge about Hexagonal Architecture
- Understanding of model happening in DDD (Aggregate, Value Object)
- Understanding of CQRS (Command, Event, Query)

#### Windows Support

Nobody likes you, use Unix-like system (WSL2, MacOS, Linux) or go away.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keinsell/methylphenidate.git
cd methylphenidate
pnpm install
```

### Usage

TODO.

### Development

- Read Fucking `doc/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Run `xyz deps`**, this will prepare all of the dependencies needed to run applicaton in development mode, namely:
  database, cache, tracer all of third-pary services that are out of our control.
-

## Features

- `[TODO]` **‚ö°üîã High Fckin' Voltage Batteries Included**, boilerplate it is providing all the information needed and
  documentation to just plug-and-play all the features, starting from set upping databases in local environment and
  ending up at "good enough" Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to start playing with your application.
- **üç≠ Eye Candies**, who would like to look at a boring wall of text all the time, since start of application it gives
  you
  nice and friendly developer feel, as all of us - keeping candies for ourselves so these features are disabled
  for "serious" deployments.
- **Steel-ass security**, `argon2`, `rsa4096` and `jwt` along with secure environmental variable configuration should
  deliver you a good enough security for most purposes.
- **"Where is the fucking documentation?"**, no fucking more fellas, there you have static documentation dedicated for
  Angular-like projects (`compodoc`), static generation of `GraphQL` documentation, `Swagger` documentation for REST
  API, and `eventsdoc` for event-driven applications. I would like to document websockets with `asyncapi` but sorry
  ecosystem isn't ready for that yet. I mean... You still can completly do not give a fuck about documentation and will
  hear such thing but I think you can say you tried at least lol
