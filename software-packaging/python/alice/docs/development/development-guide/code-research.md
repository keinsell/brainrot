# Code Research

* 04.10.2024. I have found [`aichat`](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat) tool which seems to have a lot of useful technologies implement but as it is with all of these AI tools, everybody is providing boilerplate and nobody is providing working example. I would be sane to take a closer look on codebase and yoink parts that aren't glued into 3rd-party servers if there are any.
