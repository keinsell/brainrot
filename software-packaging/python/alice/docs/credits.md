The software would never be created if people who are actually dealing with AI-related stuff would have >100 IQ but apparently they do not and \*_oh my gosh these python devs are literally the worst guiders of all people_\* the amount of READMEs that are fundamentally SEO spam along bought stars for GitHub Repository as "growth hacking" is the source of cancer which completely ruined GitHub over past two... maybe three years. As said before, suck my d(ocker).

I would like thank (honestly) `plandex` and `mods` as projects, the ones were huge inspiration for this little piece of shit code, `plandex` had really nice approach with planning and usage of multiple agents yet their tool in the result was "too expensive" for me (maybe I'm broke idk) and I decided to try optimize the cost and rebuilt things as "local-first". mods should be pleased for their user experience and libraries that actually allow for building such interactively nice command line applications, even through their libraries will be not used in this project they inspired me somewhere where user experience should be guided on.

* [`refact-lsp`](https://github.com/smallcloudai/refact-lsp), a tool that I have discovered at 10.10 and I very like where it's going as the codebase is neat and I appreciate Refact.ai business since start there may be a little inspiration from this tool inside this project.
