# Technology Stack

* :exclamation: Technology stack should allow for low-level interaction with operating system to touch user's GPU (CUDA/ROCm) which would provide much better user experience than doing inference on CPU. However these features may be provided by inference engines on their own.
* :bulb: Technology stack of project includes usage of **Mojo** and **Rust** which both are kinda fresh topics on the platter, there may be a lot of troubles on the road.



* **Rust:** It's currently over-hyped and of course there will be a rise in a model inference in this language - we're able to see first Rust-native inference engines instead ones written in Python. I have decided to build as much as it's possibly can be in Rust.
* **Mojo: Fr**
