# CI/CD Architecture

### Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow:

1. **Pre-Build Phase:**
    - **Code Quality Assurance:**
        - Linting: Automated code analysis for potential errors and coding standards.
        - Formatting: Auto-formatting code for consistency.
    - *(This phase is automated and acts as a preliminary check before the build process.)*

2. **Build Phase:**
    - **Compilation and Build:**
        - Convert source code into executable programs or software.
    - *(The build process is automated and set to trigger upon code commits or periodically.)*

3. **Testing Phase:**
    - **Unit Testing:**
        - Test individual components or pieces of code for proper operation.
    - **Integration Testing:**
        - Test combined parts of the application to ensure they work together correctly.
    - **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
        - Simulate user scenarios to validate the overall system.
    - *(Tests are automated and provide feedback on code quality and functionality. Dependencies like databases or
      services are mocked or staged as required.)*

### Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) Workflow:

1. **Post-Build Phase:**
    - **Packaging:**
        - Packaging built code into deployable artifacts.
    - **Release Preparation:**
        - Tagging/versioning of the release, preparing changelogs.
    - **Artifact Repository:**
        - Storing artifacts in a repository for deployment.

2. **Deployment Phase:**
    - **Infrastructure Setup:**
        - Automated provisioning and configuration of infrastructure using tools like Terraform or Ansible.
    - **Application Deployment:**
        - Deploying applications to the respective environments (staging, production).
    - **Database Migration:**
        - Applying database schema changes safely and efficiently.

3. **Post-Deployment Phase:**
    - **Monitoring and Logging:**
        - Setting up system monitors and logging for real-time performance tracking.
    - **Feedback Loop:**
        - Collecting feedback and metrics to feed back into the development cycle for continuous improvement.

### Key Features:

- **Automated Workflows:** Each phase is automated to reduce human error and speed up the development cycle.
- **Robust Testing:** Comprehensive testing ensures code reliability and quality.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Automated infrastructure provisioning and management.
- **Continuous Feedback:** Monitoring and feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement.
