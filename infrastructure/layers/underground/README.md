# Organization-Wide Infrastructure

This repository is dedicated to organization-wide resources and tools, focusing on the infrastructure side of software
development. Here, you'll find configurations and implementations for various services used by different teams within an
organization. In some cases, this might include a central `infrastructure` repository utilizing Terraform.

My objective with this project is to explore DevOps practices and deploy 3rd-party services in self-managed
infrastructure, such as my workstation, several Virtual Private Servers (VPSes), and Raspberry Pi devices.
